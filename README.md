# pathways
Holds versioned, labeled RTPJ files of all Plant Reactome pathways - past, present, and future.

We are repurposing Github "issues" to act as our tracking mechanism for the development of Plant Reactome pathways. Each RTPJ file in this repo will have a corresponding "issue" of the same pathway name. Labels and milestones will be used to denote curation status and associated release numbers. We will not close these issues but use them to keep a running reportable status on our curation efforts.
